<h1>Idea 1: Calculate a rating of location </h1>
<h2>Problem Definition: </h2>
<p>
  If I am moving to a different city, I donâ€™t know which area to live 
in. Factors such as public transportation, the cost of living, location of nearby police 
departments, hospitals, public schools, crime rate all influence my decision of location. 
</p>
<h2>User Story: </h2>
<p>
  The webapp makes the process of moving one step easier by providing users with the ability to search different places and receive a rating or livability score based on different factors about the location. The algorithm will take information regarding things such as nightlife, employment, rent, transportation, and safety and compute a rating based on this information.
</p>
<h2>User Requirements: </h2>
<ul>
  <li>The software shall provide users the ability to search any location in the US</li>
  <li>The webapp will generate livability scores based on the queries after pulling data about that location</li>
  <li>User picks a radius of a specific location to track places to live in</li>
  <li>User has an option to pick what requirements mean more to them</li>
  <li>A picture of the map with the desired radius is displayed. The map will be separated into different sections of three colours: Red, Yellow, Green</li>
  <li>(we could maybe also pull an api on available homes in that area? And return the correct contact info for that apartment?)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Data Sources - APIs: </h2>
<ul>
<li>Indeed API - employment</li>
<li>Zillow API - rent</li>
<li>Google Maps API - Transportation</li>
<li>FBI Crime Data API - crime rates</li>
<li>Bureau of Labor Statistics' Public Data API - unemployment rate, pensions</li>
<li>Civil Rights Data Collection API - schools, civil rights, etc. </li>
<li>Google Authentication</li>
</ul>
