CS 411: Final Project, A4 Team 6

<h1>Idea 1: </h1>
<h2>Problem Definition: </h2>
<p>
  If I am moving to a different city, I donâ€™t know which area to live 
in. Factors such as public transportation, the cost of living, location of nearby police 
departments, hospitals, public schools, crime rate all influence my decision of location. 
</p>
<h2>User Story: </h2>
<p>
  The webapp makes the process of moving one step easier by providing users with the ability to search different places and receive a rating or livability score based on different factors about the location. The algorithm will take information regarding things such as nightlife, employment, rent, transportation, and safety and compute a rating based on this information.
