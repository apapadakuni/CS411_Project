<h2>College Student</h2>

<p>
As a College Student, I have a google cander to organize my daily life. When I enter the web application, I will first register
with my gmail account and also put any personal information I want, such as height, weight, sex etc. Then I will import my 
google calendar and add locations to all events. I will set my daily fitness goal in miles or the ammount of calories I want to burn , so that I can receive my 
schedule dictating when to walk and what transportation to take.
